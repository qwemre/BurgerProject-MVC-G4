# BurgerProject-MVC-G4

An online food ordering platform is created using a robust tech stack, combining MVC architecture, Entity Framework, SQL Server, C#, Javascript, AJAX, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML, and Identity authentication. Users can conveniently access the system by registering and logging in. Once logged in, they can easily browse through the available menus and food items and add their desired selections to the shopping cart. The user-friendly interface allows seamless updates to personal information, and a comprehensive order history feature enables users to review their past orders.

The system also incorporates an admin interface with special privileges. Admins can log in to the system and efficiently manage the menus and products. This includes adding new items, removing outdated ones, and editing existing offerings, ensuring that the platform remains up-to-date and appealing to customers.
